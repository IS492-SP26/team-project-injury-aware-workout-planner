# Problem & importance
Musculoskeletal injuries, particularly those affecting the knee and shoulder, are common among physically active individuals. While clinical rehabilitation programs restore function at the injured site, they typically focus on localized therapeutic exercises and do not provide structured guidance for safely maintaining full-body training during or after recovery.

As a result, individuals who wish to remain active often face a practical dilemma: either restrict themselves to narrow rehabilitation routines or attempt to adapt general fitness programs without clear knowledge of movement contraindications, recovery stage considerations, or safe load progression. This gap is amplified in self-directed training environments, where users rely heavily on commercial fitness applications.

However, most existing fitness platforms prioritize performance optimization rather than injury-aware adaptation. The absence of integrated, context-sensitive guidance increases the risk of reinjury and delayed recovery, underscoring the need for systems that bridge rehabilitation considerations with everyday training.
