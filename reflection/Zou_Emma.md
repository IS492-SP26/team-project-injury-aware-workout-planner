# Summary (problem, method, findings)
This narrative review examines how artificial intelligence has been incorporated into exercise programs across settings, including performance enhancement, monitoring, and customized training. It categorizes various AI uses, including machine learning for personalization, wearable data analysis, movement evaluation, and automated feedback. The review emphasizes that AI increasingly enables tailored exercise advice based on individual traits and performance data. Nonetheless, most current efforts focus on optimizing performance outcomes rather than injury prevention or rehabilitation-specific modifications. The authors also address practical issues, including data quality, model transparency, and the necessity of validation grounded in clinical practice.

# Insights 
1.	AI personalization in exercise is currently technically feasible; however, most systems prioritize performance metrics over safety or injury management. 
2.	Effective AI-driven exercise systems depend significantly on high-quality contextual data, such as movement patterns and training history, indicating that structured input screening is essential.
3.	There exists a disparity between research prototypes and practical applications, particularly in the integration of clinical considerations into consumer fitness platforms.

# limitations/risks
As a narrative review, the paper synthesizes existing studies without conducting a systematic meta-analysis, which may introduce selection bias. The review discusses AI applications broadly but does not thoroughly evaluate clinical safety constraints, thereby limiting direct guidance for injury-sensitive implementation.

# Concrete idea that inspires your project
Our system can begin with a structured questionnaire assessing six common injuries (four knee and two shoulder), as well as time since injury and rehabilitation status. Based on this information, the AI can either generate a rehabilitation-focused full workout plan, modify a user’s existing routine, or identify high-risk timestamps in online workout videos.

# Summary (what problem, method, findings)
This systematic review and meta-analysis examine whether structured training interventions can effectively reduce the risk of knee joint injuries in physically active populations. The authors synthesized data from multiple randomized controlled trials evaluating neuromuscular, strength, balance, and proprioceptive training programs. The findings show that targeted training interventions are associated with a statistically significant reduction in knee injury incidence. Neuromuscular and multicomponent programs demonstrated consistent preventive effects. The study emphasizes that injury prevention can be addressed proactively through structured, evidence-based exercise design rather than solely through reactive treatment.

# Insights
1.	Injury prevention can be quantitatively assessed and meaningfully improved through targeted training components, rather than relying solely on post-injury rehabilitation.
2.	Multicomponent programs that integrate strength, balance, and neuromuscular training are more effective than isolated exercise interventions.
3.	Preventive strategies require structured progression and intentional design, suggesting that algorithmic systems should incorporate evidence-based movement categories rather than generic workout routines.

# limitations/risks
1.	Variability in participant characteristics and intervention protocols across studies may limit the generalizability of findings to different populations and activity levels.
2.	While the study demonstrates the efficacy of training interventions, it does not address how such programs can be personalized or dynamically adapted within real-world digital systems.

# Concrete idea that inspires your project
Instead of only avoiding risky movements, our system can integrate evidence-based preventive components—such as neuromuscular and balance training—into users’ adapted workout plans to proactively reduce the risk of knee injury.
