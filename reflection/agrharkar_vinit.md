Recommendations for rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. *British Journal of Sports Medicine, 57*(5), 259–270. [https://www.aspetar.com/en/professionals/aspetar-clinical-guidelines/recommendations-on-rehabilitation-after-aclr](https://www.aspetar.com/en/professionals/aspetar-clinical-guidelines/recommendations-on-rehabilitation-after-aclr)

### Summary

This clinical practice guideline addresses rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction. The problem it tackles is high reinjury risk and inconsistent progression criteria following surgery. The guideline proposes a criteria-based rehabilitation framework rather than relying on time-based milestones. It emphasizes quadriceps strength symmetry, neuromuscular control, psychological readiness, and objective return-to-sport testing. The findings strongly suggest that premature progression without meeting strength benchmarks increases reinjury risk.

### Insights Learned

* Strength symmetry (>90%) is critical before advancing intensity.
* Time since surgery is less important than functional readiness.
* Neuromuscular control and movement quality determine safe return-to-sport.

### Limitations / Risks

* Requires access to objective strength testing equipment.
* Assumes clinician supervision for progression decisions.

### Concrete Idea for the Project

Incorporate criteria-based progression logic where exercise substitutions depend on reported function and pain level, not just time since injury.

Willy, R. W., et al. (2019). Patellofemoral pain clinical practice guideline. *Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy, 49*(9), CPG1–CPG95. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31475628/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31475628/)

### Summary

This guideline focuses on managing patellofemoral pain (PFP). The problem addressed is overuse-related anterior knee pain and inconsistent treatment approaches. The guideline recommends combined hip and knee strengthening as primary treatment and discourages passive modalities as standalone interventions. Load management and movement retraining are central components. The findings emphasize that strengthening must be paired with careful progression to prevent symptom flare-ups.

### Insights Learned

* Hip strength significantly influences knee pain outcomes.
* Load management is more important than simply strengthening harder.
* Exercise therapy is more effective long term than passive treatments.

### Limitations / Risks

* Requires accurate assessment of movement quality.
* Pain variability makes rigid programming unsafe.

### Concrete Idea for the Project

Flag deep knee flexion or high-load squatting movements in YouTube videos when users report elevated pain levels.

### Summary

This guideline addresses osteoarthritis (OA) management. The problem involves chronic degenerative joint pain and functional decline. The guideline strongly recommends both aerobic and resistance exercise as first-line treatment. It emphasizes patient education, weight management, and symptom-guided progression. Findings reinforce that exercise is foundational in OA care, but progression must respect fluctuating pain levels.

### Insights Learned

* Exercise is essential, not optional, in OA management.
* Both strength and aerobic training are beneficial.
* Pain-aware progression prevents flare-ups.

### Limitations / Risks

* Pain levels can fluctuate unpredictably.
* Overloading too quickly may worsen symptoms.

### Concrete Idea for the Project

Adjust substitute exercises based on reported pain score (e.g., replace high-impact jumps with low-impact step-ups).

van der Wal, R. J. P., et al. (2022). Rehabilitation after meniscal repair: A systematic review and evidence-based protocol. *Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics, 9*, 74. [https://jeo-esska.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40634-022-00521-8](https://jeo-esska.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40634-022-00521-8)

### Summary

This systematic review examines rehabilitation protocols after meniscal repair. The problem addressed is variability in postoperative progression and risk of compromising healing tissue. The authors compare accelerated versus restricted rehabilitation approaches. Findings support controlled early motion and staged weight-bearing progression while protecting the repair site. Return-to-sport should depend on functional testing rather than timeline alone.

### Insights Learned

* Early motion can be beneficial if controlled.
* Deep flexion and pivoting should be carefully staged.
* Protocol variability suggests need for structured guidance.

### Limitations / Risks

* Surgical technique influences rehabilitation decisions.
* Evidence variability across studies.

### Concrete Idea for the Project

Automatically flag deep knee flexion exercises (e.g., full squats) for users early after meniscal repair.

Lai, X., Chen, J., Lai, Y., Huang, S., Cai, Y., Sun, Z., Wang, X., Pan, K., Gao, Q., & Huang, C. (2025). Using large language models to enhance exercise recommendations and physical activity in clinical and healthy populations: Scoping review. *JMIR Medical Informatics, 13*, e59309. [https://medinform.jmir.org/2025/1/e59309](https://medinform.jmir.org/2025/1/e59309)

### Summary

This scoping review analyzes how large language models (LLMs) are used in exercise recommendations. The problem addressed is the high time burden and expertise required to create personalized exercise plans. The authors reviewed 11 studies examining AI-generated exercise prescriptions. Findings suggest LLMs can improve personalization and engagement but must function as decision-support tools rather than replacements for clinicians. The paper also emphasizes retrieval-augmented grounding and expert validation to ensure safety.

### Insights Learned

* LLMs are best used as structured support tools.
* Grounding outputs in validated guidelines reduces risk.
* AI is particularly suited for mid-stage rehabilitation where structure exists.

### Limitations / Risks

* Limited large-scale clinical validation.
* Risk of unsafe recommendations without expert oversight.

### Concrete Idea for the Project

Use generative AI to interpret transcripts and normalize exercise names, but restrict substitute generation using rule-based injury constraints grounded in rehabilitation guidelines.
